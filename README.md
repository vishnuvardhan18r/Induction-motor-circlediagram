# induction-motor-circlediag
Python program that draws circle diagrams for 3-phase induction motors.

circle_star.py draws the circle diagram of a star connected 3-ph induction motor and calculates it various paramters such as operating point slip, stator current, rotor current, power factors, output power, max output power, max torque, slip at max torque, etc.

circle_delta.py draws and calculates the same for a delta connected 3-ph induction motor.
